Although cultural differences may also influence the venues nearby campuses, this will be excluded from the analysis, under the assumption that all campuses have a diverse, international student body.\n\nThe goal of the project is to identify what universities have similar venues and cluster them in qualitatively reasonable clusters."

Additional universities, other than the ones mentioned above, may be included for a even more thorough analysis of university campuses.\n\nThe data will be used to extract reasonable features. The features will be encoded in such a way that the scaling problem is not an issue, e.g. using one-hot encoding for categorical variables, such as university type. The features will also be scaled to avoid improper weight on the different features. If this is not done, the size feature is likely to dominate the feature space, as it would likely have dominated being the scales of thousands, compared to the one-hot-encoded university type being either 0 or 1. After applying a clustering algorithm, for instance, kmeans, for different k. A k will be chosen based on the resulting clusters having the most reasonable qualitative description.
